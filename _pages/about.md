Hi! I'm Edward, a second year computer science PhD candidate at Washington University in St.Louis. I am interested in computational biology where I am excited to learn about what biological insight new types of biological data being produced these days can offer. My current research interest focuses on how alternative splicing can change proteome and affect on longevity-related traits.
